# 3D Car Game

This is a 3D endless runner car game built with Three.js. The game features smooth controls, a lane system, and progressive difficulty for an authentic arcade experience.

## Features
- **Free Movement:** Smooth left/right movement with no lane restrictions.
- **Smooth Controls:** Acceleration, deceleration, and friction make the car movement feel realistic.
- **Car-like Obstacles:** Oncoming cars move straight towards the player with realistic car geometry.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Obstacle frequency increases as your score goes up.
- **Advanced Collision Detection:** Multiple collision algorithms for accurate detection.
- **Score System:** Score increases as you drive forward.
- **Game Over & Restart:** Colliding with an obstacle ends the game. Click 'Restart' to play again.

## Controls
- **Left/Right Arrow or A/D:** Move left/right
- **Up Arrow or W:** Accelerate forward

2. Use either arrow keys or WASD to control your car and avoid obstacles.
3. Try to get the highest score possible!

## Improvements Made
- Refactored code for maintainability (external CSS/JS).
- Implemented smooth free movement with physics-based controls.
- Added car-like obstacles with realistic geometry (body, roof, wheels, headlights).
- Reduced player speed for better control and challenge.
- Implemented advanced collision detection algorithms.
- Added progressive difficulty scaling.
- Cleaned up and modularized the game logic.
